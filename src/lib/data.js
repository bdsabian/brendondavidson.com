  `I'm Brendon Davidson, a 34-year-old web developer from Rochester, NY currently living near 
    Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I've been developing web applications for nearly 20 years.  I have vast 
    experience with web application architecture, database design, backend and frontend 
    development using a variety of languages and frameworks.`,
  `I discovered programming at the age of 10 and instantly fell in love. Often to the dismay of my 
    parents, I spent countless hours devouring technical programming books and banging out code on
    the family computer. The same qualities that led me to coding back then still drive me today: 
    a strong curiosity for understanding how things work and a love for the challenge of discovering pracitcal solutions
    to difficult problems.`,
  `Throughout my career I've amassed a wide range of knowledge and skills and continue to enjoy 
    keeping up with the latest innovations.  I've designed and built many systems from simple responsive web 
    pages to a highly scalable platform for measuring ad engagement for a company that was eventually 
    purchased by one of the largest market research companies in the world.`,
  `My biggest passions outside of work are travel and photography. When I'm not working, I'm out 
    exploring the world, seeing new places and experiencing new cultures. I've been fortunate to 
    have climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro, gone rafting through the Grand Canyon, walked through ancient 
    Macchu Picchu, and more.`
